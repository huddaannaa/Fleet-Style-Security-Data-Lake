## Introduction

This document outlines the design and implementation of a robust security architecture for a cybersecurity data collection and processing system leveraging the Fleet Server style. The architecture is designed to protect the system against evolving cyber threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of security data.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this document are:
- To design a comprehensive security architecture for the data collection and processing system.
- To provide detailed strategies for securing network, endpoints, data, and access controls.
- To outline best practices for implementing and maintaining the security architecture.
- To emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement.

## Threat Landscape

Understanding the threat landscape is crucial for designing a robust security architecture. The system must be protected against various threats, including:

- **External Attacks**: Such as DDoS, phishing, malware, ransomware, and zero-day exploits.
- **Internal Threats**: Including insider threats, accidental data leaks, and unauthorized access.
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Sophisticated, long-term attacks aimed at stealing sensitive information.
- **Data Breaches**: Resulting from weak encryption, poor access controls, and vulnerabilities in the system.
